CA-TPD,NA,NA,4,"CA-TPD is a 90-year old managed deciduous (Carolinian Species) forest of the Turkey Point Flux Station. Meteorological and flux data collection was started on 5 January 2012. The data set documented here includes carbon, water and energy fluxes and meteorological and soil measurements.
\n
\nA unique aspect of Turkey Point Flux Station is its geographic location between the boreal and the broadleaf deciduous forest transition zone. It provides an excellent opportunity to investigate and quantify the strength of the carbon sink or source for planted temperate conifer forests, and its sensitivity to seasonal and annual climate variability.
\n
\nThe forest is naturally regenerated on sandy terrain and abandoned agricultural land. Predominantly hardwood species with a few scattered conifers. Site has been managed (thinned) in the past. It has a high biodiversity with 573 tree and plant species, 102 bird species, 23 mamal species and 22 reptile and amphibian species (SWALSREP Report, 1999).  The dominant tree species is white oak (Quercus alba), with other scattered broadleaf Carolinian species including sugar and red maple (Acer saccharum, A. rubrum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), black and red oak (Q. velutina, Q. rubra) and white ash (Fraxinus americana) . There are also scattered conifers, mostly white and red pine (Pinus strobes, P. resinosa), comprising about 5% of the trees. Average tree height is 25.7m with a stand density of 504 ��� 18 trees per hectare. Average tree diameter at breast height is 22.3 cm and basal area is 0.06 m2 or approximately 29 square meters per hectare.","Active, core measurements presently being made","Ontario, Canada",Ontario - Turkey Point Mature Deciduous,42.6353,-80.5577,260,DBF,Deciduous Broadleaf Forests,NA,35.4,NA,NA,,,,,

The site is characterized as Local Climate Zone 11 'low plant cover'. Instruments used in this study to measure radiative and turbulent fluxes were sited on a tripod system (CM-115, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA), 1.5 and 1.8 m above the local ground surface. The site was colonized by a diverse set of tall grasses that ranged in average stand height between 0.5 m (winter) and a maximum of 175 m (August 2009). Heights of most instruments were adjusted in summer to account for the growing grass height. There were no trees or shrubs within 130 m radius of the tripod, and the site fulfills are requirement for micrometeorological flux measurements (flat, extensive fetch). The site was located close to the shoreline (Strait of Geogria) in the Delta of the Fraser River. The area is dominated by intensive farming, but the landuse in the source area of the tower was unmanaged and non-irrigated.","Inactive, core measurements no longer being made","British Columbia, Canada",Westham Island,49.0863,-123.1768,1,CSH,Closed Shrublands,NA,,NA,NA,,,,,

Will enable detection of possible systematic errors associated with the larger scale measuring system of the first tower.  This tower became operational in 1999 until the beginning of 2001.  As of September 2006, the tower is operational and runs continuously.

JP-YMS,NA,NA,NA,"Yamashiro forest hydrology research site is located in the southern part of Kyoto prefecture. The site is in a broadleaf forest which is built up on weathered granite and the forest is also one of headstreams of Kizu River. The region used to be cleared off as it was managed as a suburban forest, until a century ago, when the green development operated by Johannis de Rijke has brought vegetation restoration. After the invasion by pine wilt disease in 1980_���s, Konara oak has taken over and the forest is now regenerated. Such secondary forests are widely distributed throughout Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe and Seto Inland Sea coast area. Yamashiro research site was established to study internal mechanism of carbon circulation and to develop the flux observation method in such ecosystem. This site can be characterized by twin towers (one on the ridge and the other in the valley) to observe space variation in complex terrain. Several cooperative projects are carried out with neighboring universities to quantify the amount of fixed carbon and to find out the mechanism of carbon cycle. Our research activity covers wide range of areas which include long term continuous observation of seasonal change using automated chambers and REA observation of trace gas flux as well as common ecological investigations. Some studies are focusing particularly on high respiration activity of root and litter, and some are concentrating on the loss of noctornal flux by drainage flow or horizontal advection.","Active, core measurements presently being made",Japan,Yamashiro Forest Hydrology Research Site,34.7948,135.8462,187,MF,Mixed Forests,NA,,NA,NA,,,,,

Disturbances tend to occur on a 7 to 10 year cycle, mostly related to Hurricane activity. Prescribed fires have been conducted since 1969 to control understory fuel.

The eddy-flux tower footprint was classified as ~48% mixed age, ~27% old growth, and ~25% young aged stands. Considering that the forest has never been logged, the ~259 year history of fire disturbances is directly linked to the three classes of stand ages. First, the old-growth component has remain unchanged since a 1748 fire that caused a 100% stand replacement. In 1854, a second fire resulted in a 50% stand replacement. Finally, the youngest trees (~54 years) in the region are the result of a 50% replacement fire in 1944. Due to this local stand variation, qualitative descriptions of biological processes at the old pine site are typically divided into mixed-age and old growth components.

Upland forests occupy 62% of the 1.1 million acre Pine Barrens and can be divided into three  dominant stand types, Oak/Pine (19.1%), Pine/Oak (13.1%), and Pitch Pine/Scrub oak (14.3%).  The majority of mature upland forests are the product of regeneration following late 19th  century logging and charcoaling activities. Among the regenerated stands of the same age,  tree structure and aboveground biomass are least in the Pitch Pine/Scrub oak stand (Cedar  Bridge) and greatest in the oak-dominated Oak/Pine stand (Silas Little). Gypsy moths first  appeared in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey in 1966. Since the time of arrival, the upland  forest stands have undergone several episodes of defoliation, the most significant occurred  in 1972, 1981, and 1990. In 2007, the Silas Little Oak/Pine stand, was completely defoliated  from the end of May until mid-July, defined by a greater than or equal to 75% reduction in  canopy foliage. The 2007 understory leaf area index maxima dropped to 0.2 from 0.4-0.5 in  the prior year when the canopy remained absent of defoliation. Understory LAI rebounded to  0.8 in 2008, eventually reaching a 2009 maximum value of 1.0.
